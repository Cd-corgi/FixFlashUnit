# âš™ FixFlashUnit ðŸ”¨

### Alpha v1.0.2 - By cd-corgi

# How it works?

This is a little **Python application** that make the attempt to **rescue/fix** your pendrive, SD-card, some other flash drives... And the HDD or SDD? Nope. :)

# ðŸ”¨ How to use it

> 1. You need at first place ***Python*** installed in your computer.
> 
> 2. Clone or download the code from the repo...
> 
> 3. Execute (as Admin for windows) the program with the following command: `python Fixflashunit.py`
> 
> * (In case of windows) Select the Drive right letter and press enter... (remember, as admin).
> * (In case of linux) Select the File system's name Example: sdb, sdc, sde, etc.
> 
> 4. In case **if the app works, good**, your drive is safe now. **If not**, you should contact to technical support of your drive, or looking for more alternatives (I'm honest on that, because not every program will work properly)



# Reason to develope this application

> *One of my two siblings is a photographer, and he's constantly suffering partition corruption,*
> *he's constantly calling me to fix the problem, in my case I use Windows 10 as main OS, and I was used to make the typical "chkdsk /F \<drive>" and he just said:*
> 
> *"Please make something to make this process a bit easier"*
> 
> *It made me get ready to code it fast as possible and fixing more bugs or adding more features...*
