# Reason to develope this application

> *One of my two siblings is a photographer, and he's constantly suffering partition corruption,*
> *he's constantly calling me to fix the problem, in my case I use Windows 10 as main OS, and I was used to make the typical "chkdsk /F \<drive>" and he just said:*
> 
> *"Please make something to make this process a bit easier"*
> 
> *It made me get ready to code it fast as possible and fixing more bugs or adding more features...*
